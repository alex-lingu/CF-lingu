Lingumania lets you translate your website in context and launch localized versions of your website the quick and easy way.


#### Translate Your Website

Our visual editor highlights all translatable content on your website and allows you to translate it in context, with machine translations offered as suggestions.

#### Launch Translated Sites

Once your translation cycle is done, you can launch your translated websites directly from our platform. Lingumania acts as a traffic broker between your website and your site users, replacing your web content with pre-submitted translations before it gets to the browser. This process is invisible to your site users and search engine crawlers who see the translated sites as if they were delivered from your server directly, with page loads comparable to your current site's speed, and further enhanced by CloudFlare's CDN.


#### The App

This app will add a menu to your website that lets you launch our visual translation editor so you can easily translate yourself or order professional translations for your website. The menu also gives you a percentage indicator of current page's translation progress, and lets you preview each page in new languages while it's being translated. This is an admin app and only you or the people you give access to will see this menu on your website.
